* For generating the ppa package look into the launchpad dir.
* For developing, you can use `Qt Creator` (Open source license). https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools
* The code works with QT6 as well as QT5. However the ppa package is QT5 based as it needs to work for ubuntu 20.04 as well which doesn't have QT6.


[Launchpad link](https://launchpad.net/~shubhamshuklaerssss/+archive/ubuntu/autog)

Autog is aimed at increasing the productivity of the grader. It takes Latex(with scanned answer page embedded inside) as input and provides the user with a nice interface to put comments and marks. It updates the
Latex with the user input, compiles it and displays the output PDF live. It is a part of a whole system of computerized grading used in Mathematics Department, IITG. Special answer sheets are used were students write the answers in designated places. Each page has a code that uniquely identifies the page number as well as the identity of the student whose answer sheet it is. All the pages are scanned and then the grading workload is distributed to the TAs through some scripts. Then the grading happens through Autog. After grading, some scripts compile all the results and enable students to access their graded answer sheets online(Helpful when students are on vacation).
